Screenshots of the official website for each member of Congress. 

Each screenshot filename contains a timestamp when it was taken with the number of seconds since Epoch (`Time.now.to_i`).

Taken with [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) on 6/12/2013 with member data from the [Sunlight Congress API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/). Since it's with phantomjs, some things may appear differently in the screenshots (webfonts, flash, annoying lightboxes, etc.).
